The interior of this luxurious ride was inspired by Japanese design and it is crafted from hand-woven silk. The exterior is just as awe-inspiring, with a mother of pearl resemblance. With a V12 engine and 8-speed transmission, this venerable machine can really move, and it is also the cheapest on this list, coming in at just under £1 million."
