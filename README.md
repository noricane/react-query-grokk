# react-query-grokk

In this repository I grokked TanStack Query in the main branch before deciding 
to move on to Redux Toolkit & Redux Toolkit Query.

Main branch: TanStack Query implementation
Redux branch: Redux Toolkit & RTK Query implementation

Both branches are based around the exact same ui and logic (may be some slight differences but the project is essentially the same). I.e it is the same application but with two different approaches to managing client-side state and 
the synchronization of client-side state with server-side state.

The idea of the repository was to grokk react query a little since it is a very widely used async client-side <-> server-side synchronization library that handles various scenarios (retries, automatic refetch, caching etc.) with it's implemented mechanisms.

What ended up happening was that I 

This will by no means be a large or even medium sized project. I will simply play around a bit here while learning react-query on a deeper level to be able to use it in enterprise scale codebases.
