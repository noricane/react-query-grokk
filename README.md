# react-query-grokk

The idea of the repository is to grokk react query a little since it is a very widely used async clienside server synchronization library that handles various scenarios (retries, automatic refetch, caching etc.) with it's implemented mechanisms.

This will by no means be a large or even medium sized project. I will simply play around a bit here while learning react-query on a deeper level to be able to use it in enterprise scale codebases.
